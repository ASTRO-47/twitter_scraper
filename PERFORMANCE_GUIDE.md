# Twitter Scraper - Performance Optimization Guide

## Quick Speed Settings

### Ultra Fast (5-10 seconds)
Edit `scraper_config.py`:
```python
MAX_TWEETS_PER_PROFILE = 10
MAX_FOLLOWERS = 20
MAX_FOLLOWING = 20
ENABLE_SCREENSHOTS = False
SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME = 0.5
```

### Fast (15-30 seconds)
Edit `scraper_config.py`:
```python
MAX_TWEETS_PER_PROFILE = 30
MAX_FOLLOWERS = 50
MAX_FOLLOWING = 50
ENABLE_SCREENSHOTS = True
SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME = 1.0
```

### Balanced (30-60 seconds) - Default
```python
MAX_TWEETS_PER_PROFILE = 50
MAX_FOLLOWERS = 100
MAX_FOLLOWING = 100
ENABLE_SCREENSHOTS = True
SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME = 1.5
```

## Key Performance Improvements Made:

1. **Reduced Limits**: Lowered default tweet/follower/following limits
2. **Faster Timeouts**: Reduced wait times throughout the scraper
3. **Parallel Processing**: Followers and following now scrape in parallel
4. **Smart Scrolling**: Reduced scroll attempts and wait times
5. **Optional Screenshots**: Can disable screenshots for much faster scraping
6. **Configurable Settings**: Easy to adjust via config file
7. **Better Error Handling**: Faster recovery from timeouts

## Performance Tips:

- **Disable screenshots** for 50-70% speed improvement
- **Reduce tweet limits** for faster tweet scraping
- **Disable followers/following** if not needed
- **Use lower SCROLL_PAUSE_TIME** for faster scrolling (minimum 0.5s)

## Usage:

1. Edit `scraper_config.py` with your desired settings
2. Run the scraper normally
3. Check the logs for current configuration and performance metrics

The scraper will now show configuration details at startup and complete much faster!
